# Lexer

This is a small lexer I wrote while trying to get more acquainted with Rust.
I did have some [pretty solid inspiration](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2ow729/writing_a_lexer/) to work from.
The `main` fn isn't implemented, currently I just have a single test.
Fortunately, cargo is amazing and all you have to do is run `cargo test` and it installs/compiles dependencies and runs the rest. Beautiful.
I'm really enjoying Rust so far :blush:
